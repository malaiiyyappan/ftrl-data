# FTRL Data Analysis Project Aims

Instead of writing a mega blog post full of numbers, I realized this could be better used as a series of short posts, making deep dives into a single chokepoint.

- Identify areas of improvement where rail network should be strengthened
  - How many bus trips are taken from a certain station/bus transfer point? Do they all go in a general direction?
  - See if any LTA projects already exist to help alleviate this problem
  - Propose alternates (but of course, they should already be doing this)
- Identify areas where a danger of too much/too little service may be provided
  - Subjective, yes, but perhaps express service can be considered?
  - Or should we be avoiding transit deserts, as they say?
- If I can get the data, I'd like to know how well-patronized are certain interchanges.

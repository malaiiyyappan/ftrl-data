# ftrl-data
Scripts to process ridership data from LTA's Datamall.

- In time to come I want to see if I can do something more with this. Maybe a page showing busiest travel routes or something?
- Might write about this on the blog someday. For now, though, I'm biding my time...

The data available in the `processed_data` folder is released under the Singapore Open Data License. They're the same data that's available from Datamall, just run through the scripts in this repository.

Format of said processed data contains the same fields as you'll find in the LTA's documentation.

If you want, you can also convert them to process bus stop data - just replace all mentions of "train" with "bus".

# ftrl-data
Scripts to process open data from LTA's Datamall.

- I'm not sure if I can release the actual data itself, either in raw or processed form, so don't ask.
- In time to come I want to see if I can do something more with this. Maybe a page showing busiest travel routes or something?
- Might write about this on the blog someday. For now, though, I'm biding my time...
